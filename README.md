# Secure Zero-Trust Textual Information Storage

## Introduction

This project is a secure, zero-trust information storage system, where all encryption takes place client-side using the GPG encryption library. The system is designed to store both textual and binary data securely. In addition to storing information, users can also share their encrypted notes with other users and revoke access to the notes at any time. The system also includes a feature that allows users to mount their notes as a fuse filesystem, making it easy to view and edit their notes with any text editor.

## Key Features
- User profiles are linked to their public keys
- Information is encrypted using symmetric key encryption
- The symmetric key is encrypted with the author's public key
- Information can be shared and re-encrypted with another user's public key for added security
- The ability to mount notes as a fuse filesystem
- The ability to revoke access to shared notes by rotating the symmetric encryption keys
- Supports storing both textual and binary data

## Technical Details
1. User profiles are created with their public keys and stored in the system.
2. When a user creates a note, its contents, whether textual or binary, are encrypted on the client-side using a symmetric key, generated by the user.
3. The user then encrypts the symmetric key with their public key and sends the encrypted note and encrypted symmetric key to the server.
4. To view the note, the user fetches the encrypted note and encrypted symmetric key from the server, decrypts the symmetric key using their private key, and uses the decrypted symmetric key to decrypt the note contents.
5. To share the note, the user fetches the recipient's public key from the server, encrypts the symmetric key with it, and publishes the result to the server.
6. The recipient of the share can fetch the encrypted note and encrypted symmetric key, decrypt the symmetric key, and use it to decrypt the note contents.
7. To revoke access to the note, the author rotates the symmetric encryption keys, re-encrypts the note contents with a new generated symmetric key, and only publishes the encrypted symmetric key for users whose access isn't revoked.
8. The notes can be mounted as a fuse filesystem, allowing users to view and edit them with any text editor.

## Security
This system is designed to be secure and ensure the privacy of user information by utilizing the latest encryption techniques and libraries. All information, whether textual or binary, is encrypted on the client-side, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to access it. Additionally, the ability to revoke access to shared notes by rotating the symmetric encryption keys adds an extra layer of security.

## Conclusion
This project provides a secure solution for storing and sharing information with a focus on privacy and security. With its client-side encryption, zero-trust architecture, public key encryption, fuse filesystem integration, and the ability to revoke access, it offers a comprehensive and secure way to store and manage sensitive information, whether it be textual or binary.
